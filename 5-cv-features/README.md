# Episode 5: Descriptor Matching and Object Detection
Use features and descriptors to track the car from the first frame as it moves from frame to frame. Store (ORB) descriptors in a Mat and match the features with those of the reference image as the video plays. Learn to filter out extraneous matches with the RANSAC algorithm. Then multiply points by a homography matrix to create a bounding box around the identified object. The result isnâ€™t perfect, but try different filtering techniques and apply optical flow to improve on the sample implementation. Getting good at computer vision requires both parameter-tweaking and experimentation.

The code as explained in the video doesn't work, or at least I could not reproduce it, but I found [this](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1026243/jetson-tx1/orbfeaturedetector-problem-when-using-opencv/) with a working code. The code transform the [cars.mp4](./cars.mp4) into a video where the features are highlighted and car bounding box is shown [cars_features](./cars_features.avi). Mostly, the code could not find the car, but...
