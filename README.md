# NVIDIA Jetson TX1 OpenCV 101 Tutorials

![Hello!](./images/hello.png)

In this repo, you will found the code from the [OpenCV 101 tutorials](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/learn/tutorials). The tutorials a bit old and there are a couple of things that need to be fixed to be implemented with OpenCV 3.3.1.



## Dev evironment

- [NVIDIA Jetson TX1 Developer Kit SE](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/buy/jetson-tx1-devkit)
- [JetPack 3.3](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack)
- OpenCV 3.3.1
- CMake 3.5.1
- Midnight Commander

## Tutorials

- [0-cv-hello](./0-cv-hello):  Episode 0 - [Introduction to OpenCV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvmP0WRVUxI): Learn to write your first ‘Hello World’ program on Jetson with OpenCV. You’ll learn a simple compilation pipeline with Midnight Commander, cmake, and OpenCV4Tegra’s mat library, as you build for the first time.

- [1-cv-mat](./1-cv-mat): Episode 1 - [CV Mat Container](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQfWANnqmps) Learn to work with mat, OpenCV’s primary container. You’ll learn memory allocation for a basic image matrix, then test a CUDA image copy with sample grayscale and color images.
